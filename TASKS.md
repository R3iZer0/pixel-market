- [x] `/api/meta/callback` — exchanges code → short token → long-lived token, stores in profiles

- [x] Profile auto-created on signup (trigger fixed: collision-safe, RLS-safe, error-tolerant)
- [x] Dashboard shows ALL pixels + custom audiences + lookalikes + engagement audiences from Meta
- [ ] Google OAuth tested end-to-end (button present)
- [ ] Token refresh cron (60-day expiry — must build before launch)

---

  - [x] Engagement audience: same as custom
  - [x] Lookalike: same as custom (lookalikes ARE custom audiences)
  - [x] Pixel: `POST /{pixel_id}/shared_accounts` (requires BM on both sides) — code done, untested
- [x] `/dev/test-transfer` — manual trigger UI for testing
- [x] `/api/meta/assets` — list pixels + audiences per ad account
- [x] `/api/meta/asset-details` — deep enrichment per asset (pixel /stats, audience lookalike_spec recursion)
- [ ] Token refresh cron (Vercel cron, daily)
- [ ] Auto-pause listings on token failure + notify user

---

## Phase 6 — Checkout & Payments (NEXT)

---

## Phase 9 — Messaging ✅

- [x] **Price offers** — separate `price_offers` table
  - [x] `/api/offers` POST — create offer (auto-withdraws prior pending from same buyer)
  - [x] `/api/offers/[id]/accept` — seller accepts → message posted, buyer can checkout at offer price
  - [x] `/api/offers/[id]/reject` — seller rejects
  - [x] `/api/offers/[id]/withdraw` — buyer withdraws
  - [x] Offer cards rendered inline in chat timeline (mixed with messages, color-coded by status)

---

## Phase 10 — Settings & Profile ✅
